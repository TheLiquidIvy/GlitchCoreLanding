# GlitchCoreLanding

    Visuals: Dark, dystopian background with neon accents (electric blues, purples, hot pinks, lime greens). Elements will have subtle "glitch" effects – flickering, color shifts, slight distortions.
    Animated Elements: Instead of floating candies, we'll have digital particles, circuit board patterns, or abstract tech shapes that subtly animate or "glitch."
    Quiz Theme: "The Glitch Test" or "Cyber-Identity Scan" – a quiz to determine the user's alignment with the GlitchCore aesthetic or their "cyber-cred."
    Cheeky Responses: Adapted to a tech/cyberpunk lexicon.
    Strategic Follow-ups: Tailored to either welcome them into the "Inner Core" (correct answer) or guide them to "re-program their wardrobe" (incorrect answer).
